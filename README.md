# Quantitative Finance: Options Greeks Monitor

This repository contains a professional-grade tool for pricing and analyzing the sensitivity of **European Options** using the Black-Scholes model.

## Overview
As an Investment Strategist, I developed this module to visualize how derivative exposures (Greeks) behave under different market conditions. This tool is essential for **Dynamic Hedging** and risk management of complex portfolios.

## Key Features
- **Theoretical Pricing:** Call option pricing based on Black-Scholes.
- **Greeks Calculation:** Real-time computation of **Delta** and **Gamma**.
- **Visual Analytics:** Matplotlib integration to plot sensitivity curves.

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy & SciPy:** For high-performance numerical computing.
- **Matplotlib:** For financial data visualization.

## Example Output
The script generates a dual-axis chart showing the relationship between the Underlying Price, Delta (exposure), and Gamma (acceleration).
